# The Genesis

The initial idea about SaySomething2.world


## About core members of our team

Not too much people, and we work online:

- 2 engineers, from UK
- 1 actuary, from SG
- 1 main investor, from UK
- 1 assistant, from HK

We have previously provided technical support,
contracts and system for projects and companies.
Not only in the field of blockchain.
During these years,
we found that more and more start-up teams
are becoming impetuous and eager for quick success.

We don not think it is healthy.
What we believe is that **wealth should be based on providing value**.


## Fact - what we faced and realized

However, not everyone thinks so.
Some people want to obtain wealth faster,
so that they designed alluring stories to raise funds in the market
through a large proportion of returns,
and many of them are even pure cash-games, **ponzi-game**, exactly.

People lose money in various scams
before they can understand what blockchain is.

It sucks.


## About blockchain

We believe that what blockchain brings to people
should be the reduction of costs,
the improvement of efficiency,
and the simplification of management processes.

Blockchain is not suitable for all industries,
and not all areas that use blockchain technology
need to show the concept of blockchain to end-users.


## Then, crypto-currencies

Like BTC, ETH...

We believe that they should not only be the current price, but should be more expensive.

Just only because: more people need to learn, understand, hold, and use them.


## A simple entry point

**Feature: impossible to be tampered with**

Many people have heard of it, but:
 
- What are the scenarios where this feature applied?
- Just only for transfer?<br>
  If so, then there are already a Bitcoin, and an Ethereum, that's enough!
- How can you experience it simply and directly?


## How can you experience it simply and directly?

So, **SaySomething2.world** comes.

You can push a message to the Ethereum blockchain,
no one, no one, I mean no one can ever edit or delete it,
even a word, even a punctuation, even yourself nor our team.

more words to type here, may be later.
