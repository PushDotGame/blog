We create value, let wealth flow and make more people rich/richer.
In this process, we promote consensus,
but only take a little bit from it.

我們創造價值、讓財富流動，並讓更多人富有。在這個過程中，促進共識，但只從中只取一點點。

Let more and more people learn, understand block-chain,
hold and use crypto-currencies is our goal.

讓更多人了解、懂得共塊鏈，持有和使用加密貨幣，是我們的目標。
